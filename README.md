Key Features of MinePort:

- Quick Server Creation
With just a few steps, you can create a new server—choosing your version, world name, edition (Java or Bedrock), and whether it should be local or public. No more dealing with complex downloads or command-line instructions.

- Public and Local Hosting Options
Not everyone wants to host a global server, and not everyone is on the same network. That’s why MinePort offers both:

- Local Mode – Perfect for LAN parties, family gaming, or classrooms

- Public Mode – Makes it easy to open your server to players from around the world, with optional port forwarding and network tips built in

Automatic Backups & Safe Recovery:

Staying current with Minecraft’s latest updates is important for features, performance, and security. MinePort lets you:

Apply updates without wiping your world

Custom Server Icon Uploader:

Java and Bedrock Edition Support

Why choose one when you can support both? MinePort understands that different players use different platforms:
